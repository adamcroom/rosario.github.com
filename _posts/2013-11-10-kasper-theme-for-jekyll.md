title: "Kasper - A theme for Jekyll"
---

[Ghost](http://ghost.org) is a very interesting blogging platform written in Node.js and 
it features a good, simple and modern theme called Casper. I really like Casper and I wanted 
to port it to Jekyll. The result is [Kasper](http://github.com/rosario/kasper).


Here's a list of what Kasper currently includes:

* Pagination
* Rss
* Google Analytics Tracking code
* Code Syntax Highlight
* Author's profile with picture
* Disqus comments


# Screenshots

Here you can find a couple of screenshots.
